# WargameCampaignManager

Lightweight cross-platform desktop app to serve as a game-system-agnostic tool for managing narrative campaigns in miniature wargaming. The idea is to have an app thatâ€™s easy to load up with premade campaigns, so that you can quickly get into the fun of playing your favourite miniature wargaming in a narrative setting.

The purpose is to be able to both create new narrative campaigns and update them inside the campaign manager, and play them inside the campaign runner.
